Sprint 1: GitHub proved difficult to use. Getting it to work right was troublesome.
We also had some issues with getting testing to work.
No major issues coding any of the user stories.

Sprint 2: 
  In our library meeting, we discussed which user stories to tackle on first. We decided to complete user story #13: As a VCU student, I want to see nutritional information of menu items so that I can choose meals that fit my diet. To do complete this, we split up and went to each restaurant that took VCU Dining dollars and wrote every single menu item, food price, and calories for every single restaurant. This was a very tedious task. After we completed user story #13, we decided to tackle on something a little easier to manage time. We decided to go for user story #17: As a student, I want to be able to look up the addresses of the VCU restaurants so I can see where their location is. We coded it easily on Android Studio. After a few hours, we completed user story #17 pretty easily.  Last but definitely not least, we decided to work on the most difficult user story, user story #1: As a VCU student, I want to sort menus by price so I can find meals that fit my budget. We had to implement a quicksort algorithm to sort the prices. We were having lots of difficulty with pulling info from the app database but after many hours, we finally completed it.

Sprint 3: In our library meeting, we discussed which user stories to tackle on first. We decided to complete user story. We worked on the favorites button (user story #11), finished working on the distance of each restaurant based on location of user (user story #14) and finished the entire restaurant database when searching restaurants (user story #7). We also added an icon for our app. Implementing the favorites button using the database caused many issues but we were able to overcome these issues by spending centuries debugging. After a while, we finally finished our app.
